<h4>Statement of Work: </h4>
<p> Our Project named Planora is an event planning and collaboration platform designed as a centralized hub for managing events, meetings, and related resources. 
It integrates essential features such as video calls, a shared calendar, real-time notes, file management, and chat, enabling teams to collaborate seamlessly. 
By consolidating multiple tools into a single application, the solution reduces app-switching fatigue, enhances communication, and streamlines workflow.  </p>
